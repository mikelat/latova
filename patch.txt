Version 0.3.2
=============
- Ported to PHP 5

Version 0.3.1
=============
- jQuery has been packaged with Latova. This is mostly javascript effects, some of which are already being used as of 0.3.1.
- Added autoparse manager. Gives you the ability to automatically convert links of media and images to being viewable.
- Added BBtag manager. It allows you to change the default latova bbtags and make your own.
- Added quick forum navigation to the bottom of forum related pages.
- Media converted from autoparsing no longer automatically loads. It gives you a funky "view it now" option, or the ability to open it in a new window.
- All media updated with its updated embedding code, making it larger. Youtubes player is now really large, and plays HD video when possible.
- Added word filters. Filters with no "replace with" text will repeat the Word Filter Character (under general) for the length of the word.

- You can now have a captcha without GD library, although it's not too effective (better than nothing). I recommend you install GD library or use recaptcha.

- Latova cache loader has been optimized.
- The "DEF_PAGE" and "SHORT_PG" config variables have been removed from config.php, remove them manually.
